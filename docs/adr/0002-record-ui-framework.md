**Title** : Use of Gio UI for the project

**Status** : Accepted

**Context** : We need to choose a UI framework for the project. 

* We want to have a modern and responsive UI that can run on multiple platforms(MacOS,Windows,Linux).
* I need a great way to develop the UI following the "Mecha-Egyptian" aesthetic of the project.
* We also want to have a good developer experience and be able to easily create custom UI components.


**Decision** : We will use the Gio UI framework for the project. 
* It can run on multiple platforms. 
* It also has a great developer experience and allows us to easily create custom UI components. 
* It has good support for animations and transitions, which will help us to create a unique and engaging user interface.

**Consequences** : Using the Gio UI framework will allow us to create a modern and responsive UI that can run on multiple platforms. It will also provide us with a great developer experience and allow us to easily create custom UI components. However, it may require some initial learning curve for developers who are not familiar with the framework. Overall, I believe that the benefits of using the Gio UI framework outweigh the drawbacks and will help us to create a unique and engaging user interface for our project.
