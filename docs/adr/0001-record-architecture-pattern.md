**Title** : Use clean architecture pattern for the project 

**Status** : Accepted

**Context** : We need to choose an architecture pattern for the project. We want to have a clear separation of concerns and make it easy to maintain and test the code. We also want to be able to easily add new features and make changes to the code without affecting other parts of the system.

**Decision** : We will use the clean architecture pattern for the project. This pattern emphasizes the separation of concerns and the use of layers to organize the code. The layers include the presentation layer, the application layer, the domain layer, and the infrastructure layer. Each layer has a specific responsibility and communicates with other layers through well-defined interfaces.

**Consequences** : Using the clean architecture pattern will help us to maintain a clear separation of concerns and make it easier to test and maintain the code. It will also allow us to easily add new features and make changes to the code without affecting other parts of the system. However, it may require more initial setup and may be more complex than other architecture patterns. Overall, i believe that the benefits of using the clean architecture pattern outweigh the drawbacks and will help.
